# AI Digit Recognizer
Overview
This project is a built from scratch Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN) the uses backpropigation to progressivly train a AI model off training data of drawn number 0 - 9. Following OOP princables this project is meant to be the highlight of years of both academic and personal projects that takes a complex and challenging concept and on goes through the software devlopment life cycle to concepturalize, create, and deliver and interactive and visually dynamic user experience.

Features
- Ability to draw and activly watch the AI's confidence values for guessing the users own digits and digits from the training data.
- Creation of new neural netoworks that allow the user to define the amount of hidden layers and the node count for each respective layer.
- Control over the learning rate and Epoch count (Cylces through whole training data) to activly train new or loaded AI models

Additional Features
- Tracking of Accuracy as AI is trained
- Display of confidence values of AI
- Ability to Load and Save models
- Testing accuracy against training data stand alone
- Ability to load digits from training data to visually see what AI guesses nubmers to be
- Ability to stop training at any time
- Progress bar to keep track of training
- Ability to change out training data

# Maproom Campus Navigation App
Overview
This project named Maproom is a collaboration between myself and two other students to create a Campus navigation app for our CS capstone project. The main focus was to create an app that would allow for mainly Freshman students comming into campus to more easily and less nervreckingly find their classes in time in unframiliar surrounding. The app shows various important building on the campus location alond with the ability for the user to searach for the class code such as CYBR 233, and find the building it is in and highlight the room location. Their was heavy important in the SDLC in all phases from planning out our requirments from what skills we had to surveys asked of new studnets to find what was most important to them in fidning their classes. Using technologies such as Github, Discord, and tools to create Gnatt charts were all used to collbtrativly to create this project.
