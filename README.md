<b>Technologies:</b> C# | WPF | .Net Framework | Visual Studio

<b>Overview:</b> A passion project that is the culmination of everything I’ve learned over the years including object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, the software development life cycle (SDLC), programming standards, unit testing, and documentation. This application is able to recognize hand-drawn or loaded digits, using a from scratch feed-forward neural network that uses backpropigation for error correction to progressively train the model. Meant to recognize number from 0 – 9, this is a highly interactive application that provides dynamic visuals on the inner workings of the neural networks confidence values. Additionally this application is interactive in not only drawing your own digits but creating a customizable neural network with adjustable training parameters such as learning rate and epoch count (iteration through training data) along with the ability to load and save existing models. This project stands a testament to how I’ve grow as a developer and my willingness to take on complex problem solving challenges.

<b>Features</b>
- Interactive confidence values where the user can draw or load digits to see the models confidence in real-time.
- Customizable neural networks with the ability for the user to define their own hidden layer size and node count for those layers.
- Control over training parameters such as adjusting learning rates and epoch counts to influence training progression.
- User-friendly interface that includes dynamic visuals, progress bars, accuracy tracking, and confidence value displays, and the ability to stop training at any time.
- Functionality to save and load models as well as change training data

<b>Challenges Overcome</b>
- <b>Comprehensive Design and Development:</b> Tackled difficulties that the complexity of a neural network has for the SDLC. This project was difficult in particular planning out the design of the neural network and testing the system for a process that has so many different components for data process through.
- <b>Testing and Reliability:</b> Focused on unit testing to ensure reliability in complex processes, learning valuable lessons in bug detection and system robustness. I learned not only how to avoid certain design pitfalls in testable but how valuable unit testing can be for detecting hard to find bugs in complex system.
- <b>Documentation and Learning:</b> Applied my documentation skills to a larger project and the importance of useful comments in understanding complex operations.
- <b>Efficiency in async and parallel tasks</b> Neural networks are an incredibly computationally heavy task, I learned to utilize async processing for continuously interactive UI but also to parallel certain task for efficient training of the neural network.
  
# Maproom Campus Navigation App
![Maproom Overview (1)](https://github.com/MyutVoilim/Projects-Portfolio/assets/54462267/b9516baa-0021-46bd-9d64-8f4a8ffba4a7)

<b>Technologies:</b> JavaScript | CSS | HTML5 | Node.js | JSON | MongoDB | Visual Studio Code

<b>Overview</b>
This project named Maproom is a collaboration between myself and two other students to create a Campus navigation app for our CS capstone project. The main focus was to create an app that would allow for mainly Freshman students comming into campus to more easily and less nervreckingly find their classes in time in unframiliar surrounding. The app shows various important building on the campus location alond with the ability for the user to searach for the class code such as CYBR 233, and find the building it is in and highlight the room location. Their was heavy important in the SDLC in all phases from planning out our requirments from what skills we had to surveys asked of new studnets to find what was most important to them in fidning their classes. Using technologies such as Github, Discord, and tools to create Gnatt charts were all used to collbtrativly to create this project.
Technologies Used

  <b>A Little More In-Depth</b>

  <b>Reflection</b>
  
  Because this project is a collaberation between three people it was important that we as a group determine what we wanted to create and the process we would use to achieve that. It was also important that we had a tangiable timeline the we ahchieved with a gnatt chart to assign tasks and keep us in line with are targets. using technolgoies like github to centralize and upload progress, Discord for communication when we couldn't not get together, and close collabration that utalized each of are backgrounds from busienss to computer science. Their were times when we could not get together because of scheduels but assigning ahead of time what each needed to to along with updates on where we were at allowed us to iterativly improve or application until the eventual creation.

  <b>Reflection</b>


Challenges
Unlike most projects i've made, this one had real impact on someones life and how they operated their business. Their is something speicial about working with real issues and devloping software to make peoples lives easier. It was paramount that focused on the clients needs rather than to just create something I thought they wanted. I needed to make sure that I properly planned for what the client needed and continuously update them and adjust as needed based on those needs. Working for the client brings special challenges but is it one of the most rewards aspects about software devlopment

# Unity AI Survival Agent
![together](https://github.com/MyutVoilim/Projects-Portfolio/assets/54462267/00130ce1-471b-4a97-af2f-f037719e5e79)

<b>Technologies</b> C# | Unity | Visual Studio

<b>Overview</b>
This project uses C# and Unity to create an AI agent that generationally improves its survivability using a basic feed-forward neutral network in conjunction with a genetic algorithm. Each agent has several stats the determine variables like speed, visions range, vision cone count, and stamina that all affect the agents ability to find and compete for food in it's environment. Several agents are be pitted against each other with the agent that lived the longest having its genetics passed on to the next with slight mutations to futher hone a progressivly competetive agent.

<b>Features</b>
- Control over agent stats and environment such as how quickly stamina drains, food availability, and agent spawn count to increase or decrease competition
- Adjustable mutation rate to control how drastically children of the orginal agent will diverge
- Toggleability of certain agent features such a whether increase vision or movement speed drain stamina faster
- Ability to save/load AI models

<b>Challenges</b>
- <b>Learning a new platform:</b>This is the first project were I used Unity which intnially slowed down devlopment, but through documentation adn demoing functinality I was able to learn and Utalize Unity's framework.
- <b>Determining a proper reward system</b>Since this was a neural network it was neccessary to determine effective metrics for what would be concidred a successful agent, in my case I used time instead of amout of food captured since an agent may eat a lot of food but burn through stamina quickly compared to a slower more effecient agent.
- <b>Balancing agent abilities</b> Find tuning how much having large vision cone or speed should effect the agents stamina to create a copmetitive environment that allowed for multiple unique routes instead of just get fast and see farther.
